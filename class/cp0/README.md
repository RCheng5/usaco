## Recursion
### Hanoi Towers

Recursion algorithm:

1. move(int n, char A, char B, char C) is the function for moving n rings from A to B.
2. When n = 1, the function will print out the current move but with the 1 ring moved from A to B.
3. First move n-1 from A to C.
4. Then move the last ring from A to B.
5. Then move the n-1 rings from C to B.
